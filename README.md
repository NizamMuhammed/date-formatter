# Date Formatter Project

This is a simple web-based date formatting tool created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The tool allows users to select a date from a dropdown menu of date formats to display the date accordingly.

## Getting Started:

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. From there, you can select a format from the dropdown menu to see the formatted date.
